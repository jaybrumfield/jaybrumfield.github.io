<div id = "Summary">
<p>Whether it was working in standardized testing where I was constantly 
    required to absorb new criteria and train teams using the knowledge I 
    had gained, or immersing myself in a new culture by teaching abroad in 
    China, I have always sought positions that required mental agility and 
    adaptation to changing circumstances. These are characteristics that 
    typify the world of software development where I believe I would thrive. 
    My ideal junior development position would be one that allowed me to 
    continue to develop the skills I have gained at Tech Elevator in order 
    to add value to a development team.</p>
